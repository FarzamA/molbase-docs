## 📌 Overview

MolBase is a full-stack chemical search platform that combines traditional RDKit-based structure search with neural embedding similarity powered by a custom Graph Neural Network (GNN).

It supports:
- Substructure, exact, and neural similarity search
- Molecule visualization and sketching
- High-performance GPU-enabled backend
- Secure authentication (OAuth, 2FA)
